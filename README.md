# ASP.NET Core Web API Teaching Demo

## About The Project

The ASP.NET Core Web API Teaching Demo is a hands-on project that guides you through the process of creating a fully functional web API from scratch. 
Using a Todo application as the project's backbone, we aim to cover essential topics such as:

- Setting up the ASP.NET Core Web API environment
- Understanding the MVC architecture in the context of APIs
- Designing and implementing models, controllers, and routes
- Performing CRUD operations
- Integrating with a database using Entity Framework Core
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Error handling and validation
- Logging
- OpenAPI documentation
- Best practices for structuring and testing your API

This project is structured to be both informative for beginners and valuable for intermediate developers looking to sharpen their skills. 
By the end of this demo, you will have a solid foundation in ASP.NET Core Web API development, capable of designing your own APIs for various applications.
